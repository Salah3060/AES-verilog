# AES-Verilog

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.

## Project Description

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe. This project provides a Verilog implementation of the AES algorithm, which can be used in hardware design for secure data transmission.

## File Structure

- **AES-verilog.v**: Main Verilog file containing the AES implementation.
- **testbench.v**: Verilog testbench for verifying the AES implementation.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this Verilog project, you need:
- A Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, XSIM)
- Basic knowledge of Verilog and digital design
